# ✨ AI Experiences Added

This edition includes three AI-focused experiences to lift the technical depth of the demo:

- `/valentine-planner` for the agent-style plan.

## Optional LLM Configuration

Set these environment variables to enable LLM explanations:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required to use the LLM)
- `OPENAI_MODEL` (optional, default `gpt-4o-mini`)
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (optional, default `https://api.openai.com/v1`)
